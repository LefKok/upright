=Overview of UpRight=

UpRight is an infrastructure and library for building high-availability distributed systems. It can automatically replicate the application server for fault tolerance. It provides the following features:
  * *High Availability*: the system can tolerate both Byzantine Faults and Crash Faults.
  * *High Performance*: the performance of the UpRight version of the system is close to the unreplicated version.
  * *Easy to use*: the application only needs to implement a set of interface functions to be incorporated into the UpRight infrastructure. This requires only a small modification to the existing code.
  * *Strong Consistency and Linearizability*: the library automatically provides strong consistency and linearizability for the application.

The architecture of UpRight? is shown in the figure. The application client sends its requests through the client library and these requests are ordered by the UpRight? Core (Order and RQ nodes). The application servers handle these ordered requests and send replies back to the clients. All nodes except clients are replicated for fault tolerance and a BFT protocol is used by the UpRight Core, so that even if a given number of nodes are down, faulty or even malicious, the whole system can still work correctly.
