#summary An introduction to the UpRight project

= Introduction to UpRight=

UpRight is an infrastructure and library for building high-availability distributed systems. It can provide the distributed system with Byzantine Fault Tolerance, strong consistency, linearizability and acceptable performance. All the programmers need to do is to implement a set of interface functions to define the functionality of a single server. UpRight will handle all the other difficult issues, like consistency, fault recovery, state transfer, authentication, etc.

The architecture of UpRight is shown in the following figure.
