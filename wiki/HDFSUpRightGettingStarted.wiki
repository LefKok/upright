#summary How to configure and run HDFS-UpRight

= Configuration =

  # UpRight must be configured properly. See [UpRightConfigurationExecution UpRight Configuration]. Notice that only namenode is replicated by UpRight, so namenodes are "UpRight servers" and datanodes are "UpRight clients". Therefore, when configuring UpRight, you should list all datanodes as clients.
  # HDFS also needs to be configured properly. See [http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/cluster_setup.html#Configuration Hadoop Configuration].
