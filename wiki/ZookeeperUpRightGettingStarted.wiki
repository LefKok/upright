#summary How to configure and run HDFS-UpRight

= Download =
  First, you need to download Zookeeper-UpRight and decompress it. Concurrently, we provide three versions of Zookeeper using blocking snapshot, Primary-Backup snapshot and COW snapshot.

= Configuration =
  # UpRight must be configured properly. See [UpRightConfigurationExecution UpRight Configuration]. 
  # Zookeeper also needs to be configured properly. See [http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_configuration Zookeeper Administrator's Guide]. We've provided a sample configuration. Notice: Cluster options are not used in Zookeeper-UpRight.
  

= Run HDFS-UpRight =
  # Start UpRight Core as described in [UpRightConfigurationExecution UpRight Configuration].
  # Start Zookeeper server: 
{{{
java -Djava.library.path=. -cp conf:zookeeper-dev.jar:log4j-1.2.15.jar:bft.jar:FlexiCoreProvider-1.6p3.signed.jar:CoDec-build17-jdk13.jar  org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMain id current.properties conf/zoo_sample.cfg
}}}
  # Start client: this depends on your application.
  # We've provided a script start_replicated.sh to start all the server nodes, including UpRight Core nodes and Zookeepr server nodes.
